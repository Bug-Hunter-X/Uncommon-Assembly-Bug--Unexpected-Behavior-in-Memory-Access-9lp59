# Uncommon Assembly Bug: Unexpected Behavior in Memory Access

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in assembly code related to memory access. The bug involves unexpected behavior due to improper handling of memory addresses.

## Bug Description

The assembly code attempts to modify a memory location at offset 0x10 from the base address in EBX.  However, it fails to account for edge cases, leading to potential issues like segmentation faults or data corruption if EBX is not pointing to a valid and writable memory region.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Assemble the `bug.asm` file. 
2. Run the resulting executable. Note the behavior (crash or unexpected output).

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling and input validation to the code. Proper handling of potential errors such as null pointers will be necessary to improve the robustness and reliability of the code.

## Additional Notes

This is a simplified example. Real-world scenarios might involve more complex memory access patterns and potential issues.
